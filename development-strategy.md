# Development Strategy

> **Testing Project Week 1: Ararys of Numbers**

The aim of this project is to practice Javascript with arrays of numbers, using iteration methods of `for loop` and simple methods of arrays such as to add an element to the list `.push`.  

Here the users can add their own numbers, reset all the number, see which numbers are bigger or smaller than the number they want to check, etc.
